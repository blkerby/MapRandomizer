next release:
- caution tape on doors leading to (otherwise unforeseeable) risk of death/softlock?
- restore tourian blue hoppers to vanilla


priority:
- from alphanimal: When "disable music" is on, could you just make it load vanilla audio channels, so some sound effects don't get messed up
- controller config special settings (moonwalk) customization
- randomized title screen
- enhancements to momentum conservation patch
  - remove need to be holding dash or to be in spin
  - reset speed boost counter whenever momentum conservation comes into play, to avoid making it too easy to get blue
  - retain speed when turning around with spin?
  - on ground, retain horizontal speed when unmorphing
    - by pressing up (or jump, if spring ball not equipped) while holding forward
  - in air, retain horizontal speed when soft unmorphing while holding forward
- door color randomization
- set up a more robust way for users to save & select presets
- move input ROM off Generate page (and into separate dialogue that only shows on first use).
- convert tech/strat AVIs to WebM & WebP (using ffmpeg CLI)
  - WebM/VP9 for full playback using HTML5 <video>
  - WebP for thumbnails
  - use image-rendering: pixelated
- add CF health refill to logic
  - tricky CF at ammo refill stations
- logic: add some 3-room shinecharge strats to logic (ones that can work with existing schema)
- add notable for underwater canGateGlitch (Very Hard)?
- remove old-format farms and refills from sm-json-data?
- make hub requirements consistent with new farm approach?
  - actually probably don't need to define hub rooms anymore:
      - just check for ability to refill each resource type from the start location and get back
- logic pages (tech/room/strat): add way to fill out items/flags/resources/obstacles to simulate logic
- take another look at boss fights
  - create table to show in help button, to make boss logic more transparent (in addition to showing formulas)
  - 5 Super phantoon fight probably needs more requirements than it currently has.
- add objectives:
  - Larvas: 4 special items (replacing missiles)
  - Random
- investigate panic during spoiler log construction:
  - RUST_BACKTRACE=1 time cargo run --bin maprando-cli -- --map ../maps/session-2022-06-03T17:19:29.727911.pkl-bk30-subarea-balance-2/1000001.json --item-placement-seed 3 --input-rom ~/Downloads/Super\ Metroid\ \(JU\)\ \[\!\].smc --output-rom ~/Downloads/testrom.smc
- investigate resource_multiplier bug that happened in Osse's seed with resource_multiplier=8:
  - https://maprando.com/seed/isnUf9YjIhvW-BJFrvFuyw/data/visualizer/index.html
  - (was from enemykill not using multiplier)
- Fix bug with cross-room jump?:
  - spoiler shows no logical path out of draygon until later than expected:
    https://maprando.com/seed/O4j4-NDrcwckyTtJMVqxdw/data/visualizer/index.html
- Slow progression item placement bug?:
  - supers placed on same step as Screw, although Missiles still available as filler:
    - https://maprando.com/seed/HwuYziIJUh-sCUM0YCAPRA/data/visualizer/index.html
  - possibly related: issue where filler items are re-randomized when trying new key item.
    - maybe re-randomizing is ok, but on success it should try replacing key item with Missile (instead of having Missile be first key item tried)
- fix quick-reload on last frame of pause/unpause
- check if reloading from bottom/top of elevator works correctly (not skips back a save)
- do something about screen shaking during samus appears (in start location: rising tide, amphitheatre)
  - maybe customization option to get rid of shaking in general?
- handle canShinesparkWithReserve in randomizer (and remove it from being ignored)
- incrementally build graph traversal with increasing difficulty tiers, acquiring flags in the process.
  - will allow better accounting of the difficulty of boss fights in forced mode
  - should be faster too
  - improved spoiler log route
- show objective progress in pause menu (also zebes awake, phantoon defeated)?
  - or maybe just make objective X's fade on map (if we do faded item dots)
- help buttons for rest of settings (e.g. explain boss proficiency calculations)
- logic simulator
- get rid of symlink for sm-json-data
- temporarily disable comeInWithGMode strats through sand since this will not be correct with how it
  is currently set up (since there is no way to go up through sand)

later:
- add animated GIFs on room/tech/strat pages for notable strats.
- maybe overhaul how randomization/customization phases work: run customization on client (with Rust WebAssembly?)
  - make it so that customization can use matching version from when the seed was generated
  - include more options for customization
  - ROM won't need to be provided for generation, only customization
- map improvements
  - fix little pause menu palette issue at top of equipment screen (green where gray should be)
- handle runways with conditional physics (Volcano Room, Amphitheatre, East Pants Room)
- check why Tourian Escape Room 1 runway isn't allowing Speedball strat into Wrecked Ship Main Shaft (on Expert)
- remove invisible solid tile in Tourian Escape Room 1, above transition
- maybe move enhanced Samus controls into separate option (instead of Max QoL)?
- enforce tech dependencies:
  - e.g. enabling "canPreciseWalljump" should enable dependency "canWalljump"
  - disabling "canWalljump" should disable dependent "canPreciseWalljump"
- gravity seems to provide 50% heat reduction on elevator ride? (Remove this.)
   - https://clips.twitch.tv/RepleteShyManateeTBTacoLeft-Ip5vQynrc0SQYQUj
   - maybe during acid chozo drain too?
- change how cross-room logic works?:
  - unify cross-room strats to go under links, with annotations on the cross-room state (in new strat properties)
  - replaces "initiateRemotely", allows obstacles and one-way cross-room paths to be handled properly
- minimal items mode:
  - could go in pending "Wild" item progression preset (along with option to allow items to be potentially required to be used in their return path)
  - taking into account objectives & MB requirements, replace unneeded items with nothings (e.g. empty Missile container)
  - keep item dots as they would have been (mixture of different possible types)
  - there's no longer a guarantee that every room can be eventually reachable
  - maybe allow customizabilty of which items can be removed:
    - some people might still want to get certain items (e.g. beams)
- consider "friendly reserve tank behavior" QoL option in max:
  - manually refilling to full doesn't empty the remaining reserves (requested by zero318)
  - i-frames don't expire during reserve? (though this would break double-damage boost strats)
  - no heat damage during reserve refill
  - maybe?:
    - energy recharge stations also refill reserve energy
    - collecting etank also refills reserves?
  - (not part of QoL:) fix crash when pausing on frame when auto reserve triggers 
  - See existing patch for some of these: https://metroidconstruction.com/resource.php?id=418
- consider bot-friendly API
- "wild" item progression mode, where new item may be required to be used for the return path.
- consider idea from selicre: "what if there was a mode in which walljumps could be unlocked by visiting etecoons (and shinesparking by visiting dachora)?"
- custom demos
- include a check that the client and server are matching versions and give a more meaningful error when they aren't
- look into botwoon requirements: 
  https://maprando.com/seed/-yvSvwjFlrfJN1NRxDi-Jw/data/visualizer/index.html
- unlock all gray doors during escape (eventually only when "enemies cleared during escape" is enabled)
  - e.g. metal pirates
- press X to fast forward during credits?
- QoL option for save station fast travel (in Max)?
- investigate problem when using quick reload (L+R+Select+Start) while unpausing with 0 energy.
- investigate: ridley gray door closed when reserve triggered (in sapphron seed)
- on seed page: for each tier, show selected tech/strats or deselected tech/strat, whichever is a shorter list
- fix escape timer tech mapping to use reverse Amphitheatre notable for can_acid_dive
- model improvement:
  - try using localized output: use token that room is placed in, instead of applying attention across all tokens
  - try nvidia transformer engine
  - increase model size, probably decrease pass factor and buffer size
  - try again using action values, to reduce the amount of computation needed
- when tile above Samus gets explored (in speedways) make it get revealed too
- fix missing Samus tile in Bomb message box (issue with map tile expansion patch)
- add logic override for strat to run under tourian blue hoppers from left (except with ultra-low QoL)
- fix: arrow map tile down to toilet doesn't get revealed (when it crosses areas)?
- logic: killing 3 musketeers with ice should require patience?
- fix toilet tile in botwoon's hallway with "vanilla map" option.
- handle 3-room shinesparks
  - at least basic case where using two-room combined runway to get a charge then jump into a 3rd room
    - should be representable with canLeaveCharged having a canComeInCharged requirement (180 frames)
  - in trickier cases, the frames in canLeaveCharged could depend on frames remaining in canComeInCharged
    - we could add a field in canComeInCharged "relativeFrameRemaining" for this
- make kraid camera act normal when entering from left
  - same thing with spore spawn entering from bottom
- handle (steep) slopes in runway length calculations
- 10 super botwoon should be possible in Expert (and 30 missile in Insane?)
- possibly adjust some of the transition marker letters:
  - make the right part of the N thicker (possibly make it 7 pixels wide?)
  - make M and W be 7 pixels wide. 
    - Mirror them to put the gap in the correct place?
    - but if it has tiles on both the left & right, what do we do?
       - keep it 6 pixels?
- maybe make Mother Brain Room reveal all its tiles (and maybe explore them too? but probably not), to be more consistent with the other boss rooms
   - on the other hand, what about minibosses and other objectives? maybe just leave all this alone?
- fix save animation colors (area-themed color looks a little bad?)
- logic: metroid tank damage may need to be higher without some tech (multiplier doesn't apply)
- fix how spoiler map sometimes won't show escape route
- see if it is possible to prevent song changes from messing up enemy behavior
- fix problem with disappearing typewriter text when pausing as escape sequence starts
- Add override for Tourian Hopper run under strat from left to top (imyt strat)
- add a tip that you can share a seed using the URL.
- logic (maybe): moondance (bowling alley), tas dance (green brin shaft)
- make graph traversals faster by using previous step for initial local states (probably not worth it?):
  - we'd have to do a full graph traversal to get spoiler route as a separate step, to avoid getting weird long paths
- in sm-json-data: use Ship refill in G-mode strats:
  - for strats that enter G-mode into Landing Site, use it, and then go back out still in G-mode
- replace Botwoon Hallway portion of Toilet level data with something more neutral
   - also remove the enemies from the Botwoon Hallway part
- fix gray door after mother brain when entering baby kraid (& metal pirates, boss rooms, etc.?)
- add patch for handling crashes? (to display the stack & registers)
- if possible, debug crash in Mt. Everest from Scottycro42 (https://clips.twitch.tv/DarlingSavageDogeMcaT-zgV9PF33MiawTpL2)
- oats seed Apr 1:
 - main street shinespark energy
 - kronic boost heatframes
 - metal pirates hitbox doesn't need plasma
- take double-hits into account correctly with reserve energy.
- check if pants room internal door connects correctly in logic
- add option (enabled on Challenge) to not treat tanks as filler items anymore after giving Varia (including the step where giving Varia)
  - maybe more general option to postpone unneeded filler items aside from missiles
- spoiler visualizer improvements (see GitHub issue)
- fix panic that is occasionally happening:
  thread 'actix-rt|system:0|arbiter:0' panicked at 'assertion failed: num_key_items_to_place >= 1', src/randomize.rs:671:9
- find some way to have forced mode take into account difficulty of defeating bosses (and other flags)
  - for each flag, identify its tier using just the flag edge (not redoing a full graph traversal)
  - then for the item placement, have the graph traversal treat that flag not as free but as whatever difficulty it was.
- consider putting back the save confirmation.
- fix graphics in door transitions?
- fix (sometimes?) glitched right door in GT. X-Ray showed a plasma beam inside it
- adjust elevator heatFrames when fast elevators enabled
- make quick reload work while in pause menu?
- refine cross room shinesparks:
    - slopes
- consider overhauling how cross-room logic is encoded:
  - canComeInCharged should be in a special part of the "node" (symmetric to "canLeaveCharged"), not in "links"
  - same thing for adjacentRunway
  - since "can" sounds like a tech, maybe we should rename these "enterCharged", "enterWithRunway", etc. (later we can have
    "enterWithSpeedball" and other things), and symmetrically, "exitCharged", "exitWithSpeedball", etc.
  - This is cleaner, reduces need for preprocessing, and would cut out the possibility of expressing invalid things
    like requiring multiple adjacentRunway from different nodes in the same strat.
- improve slow-progression logic: allow item progression by unlocking way back
  - don't immediately place filler items at one-way reachable locations
  - instead check that when a key item is placed at a previously one-way-reachable location, the item would not have provided
    a way back at an earlier step?
- fix spoiler log for reverse paths using shinesparks, G-mode, etc.
- fix bug where suit color does not change when changing suits while taking damage (e.g. lava dive)?
- fix bug where music is wrong after quick reload (even after going to next room).
- clean up the web service, to reduce the amount of boilerplate plumbing settings around.
- figure out why some rooms are dark (some FX other than palette FX?)
- fixes/improvements to area palettes:
  - add back palette FX glows using correct palettes.
  - fix palette in Crocomire cutscene when wall collapses
  - fix cutscene between MB1 and MB2
  - fix background during Ridley fight
- During escape, block backward path using room setup ASM instead of door ASM (so it can still work after leaving room another way)
  - when going into room with no doorcap (e.g. escape room 1, glass tunnel) fix how gray door appears:
    - shift to the right a tile.
    - maybe use wall PLM instead of gray door
  - or, possibly better idea: don't spawn a gray door or wall, just have it take you into post-MB-fight state of MB room
    (like escape auto-save does).
- make separate option for patching out major glitches?
  - include GT code, Spacetime beam (currently patched out)
  - make OOB cause instant death?
  - others
- Add way to export settings from seed page (and export/import on main page).
- Possible model refinment: spread out placement of single-tile, single-door rooms to help balancing of saves & refills.
- Better validation/error-handling of web service
  - push more validation into client
- Add note to strat in Post-Crocomire farming room to get to top-left with HiJump
  (run on platform enemy and jump)
- Use separate worker pool to run randomization (to avoid blocking web requests)
- Rust cleanup:
    - Use `serde_json` instead of `json` crate for loading sm-json-data.
    - Clean up error handling: get rid of a bunch of remaining unwrap()'s, etc.
- Make Gravity-only Samus palette different from Gravity+Varia.
    - Figure out how this can work with custom sprites.
- Consider rejecting cases where the set of bireachable item locations grows too slow or too fast.
- fix color of reserve tank energy in equipment menu (got messed up by colored arrows)
- move GFX colors:
  - Morph Ball room (blue brinstar), tileset 7:
    - [0x31, 0x32, 0x33] -> [0x38, 0x39, 0x3A]
- fix tiny bug: when bottom-left door of landing site is an area transition, the arrow shows up from the beginning
  of the game (due to running the door ASM while loading the game)
- fix internal checksum in output ROM
- fix suit graphics not showing after getting suit (consequence of skipping animation)?
- have forced mode take into account return path?
  - probably bad idea, because returning may not be required (before getting another item that makes it easier).
- Do something about Crocomire funny map behavior (especially when entering from left door)?


maybe someday?:
- minimizer mode? (select rooms to include randomly, hand-picked, and/or user-selected)
- make map rando for other hacks (e.g. project base, subversion?)
  - would be a lot of work. we could invite others to help implement the logic
- multitroid support


rejected ideas (probably):
- set boss flag immediately when boss dies.
- balance boss distribution (one boss per area, corresponding to vanilla?)
- consider moving the MB barriers to the right one tile (or two?), to make them interfere less with ice zeb skip.
- Option for anti-softlock patches (e.g. in Moat, Early Supers, etc.)?
  - disable acid trigger in Leodox room?
