DONE:
- fix save
- skip ceres station
- fix/remove sky scrolling in crateria
- fix door in everest
- fix mission impossible one-way
- fix toilet (keep original door asm for toilet exits)
- randomize items
- fix escape room 1 (add door transition to the right)
- fix save stations (again)
- get map roughly working without overwriting room areas
- open up statues room (which should also fix camera glitch)
- fix blue tiles (from map stations - updated data pointed to by $82:9717)
- fix issue with map areas (statues room in wrong area)

TODO:
- lock mother brain room behind bosses
  - block left side of mother brain room
- leaving mother brain should trigger zebesAblaze instead of entering escape room 1
- escape timer
- fix statues room map tiles
- fix map in toilet and east pants room 
- better solution for fixing toilet
- vanilla morph?
- door above morph ball room is pink but looks blue?
- keep door locks in boss rooms
- fix new game (instant die after respawn)
- fix big boy cutscene? (keeps happening whenever entering from right, even if has happened before)
- missing power bomb item in morph ball room (ind=1) -- maybe because zebes not awake? (also probably need to make bowling open even when phantoon not dead)
- adjust sand-fall widths to make them compatible
- graphics messed up after killing kraid
- door doesn't open after killing phantoon
- door randomization
- cross-area transitions
  - to fix graphical glitches (look into using special GFX flag?)
  - what to do with music
- try to balance map stations across areas
	- convert one tourian save to a map, so that each area gets a map station?
		- remove asm that automatically gives map in first tourian room
- eye doors before bosses?
- block kraid back door? (camera glitchy)
- change gravity/varia behavior like other randomizers
- skip gravity/varia suit-grab animation to avoid potential hard lock
- fix map icons
- parts of rooms in map not working: top of red tower, top of below-spazer, top of kago forgotten highway
- skip fanfares (like in other randomizers)
