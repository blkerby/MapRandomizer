!this_dir = HUD_Expansion

; This patch clears up tiles for additional map and hud graphics.
; In addition, the top row of the HUD is now editable.
;
; This is largely accomplished by doing 3 things:
;   1) The file select graphics are moved to a new location.
;      It can be changed to any free space at `FileSelect_BG1_GFX`
;   2) The FX graphics and message box letters are dynamically loaded
;      the bottom row of the HUD graphics. If more FX graphics types
;      are desired, the loading routines may need to be updated here.
;      Note: The bottom row of the HUD graphics is reserved. Do not 
;      use these tiles for the hud as they may be either the FX or the
;      message box letters.
;   3) The PB/CF HDMA are made more compact to allow more space for the
;      top row of the hud.
;
; Editing map graphics:
; - Graphics with an `O` are free on both the HUD and pause screen and
;   can thus be used as map tiles.
; - Graphics with an `X` can can be used but not for the map tiles.
; - The graphic tile with an '*' can only be used for message boxes.
; - Ensure that all map tiles line up on the HUD and Pause graphics
;
; Advanced map graphics editing:
; - Graphic tiles from 0x00-0xDF can all be used for map tiles if
;   they are free on both the HUD and Pause. More tiles can be made
;   available if some HUD elements are removed such as the reserve
;   AUTO and "energy" text tiles. The "%" and "x" tiles on the top
;   row are not used in vanilla and are safe to remove. 
; - Graphic tiles from 0xE0-0xFF are dynamically loaded for FX/Msg.
;   These can be completely replaced with different message box
;   graphics as long as message.ttb is updated appropriately.
; - HUD graphics 0x100-0x1FF is not normally loaded into VRAM. This
;   patch uses this space for the HUD dynamically loaded graphics.
;   If more FX graphics are added, this region is a perfect place to
;   add them.
; (Opaque Version)
; - If the text is not intended to be used on the HUD in any way and 
;   the extended message box tiles are not needed, then it should be 
;   possible to move the text tiles down over the extended tiles and 
;   move the associated pause screen tiles to a free location. The 
;   letters will only be loaded during message boxes, clearing up 32 
;   more tiles. This would require changing the many of the TTB 
;   included in this patch, including message.ttb and the pause screen 
;   ttb.
; (Transparent Version)
; - If the text is not intended to be used on the HUD in any way then
;   it should be safe to overwrite them first rows of opaque letters.
;   However to use them for map tiles, the tiles in the in the map
;   screen graphics will need to be moved elsewhere. Make sure to update
;   the area names appropriately.
;
; Free space used:
;   - Load_FX: Bank 89
;   - FileSelect_BG1_GFX: Any bank
;
; Since this patch includes many TTB and GFX data, if SMART is being
; used then the appropriate data should be added to the export directory
; and removed from this patch. Also be aware if any other patches used
; that edit any of the included TTB/GFX data.
;
; Known bugs
;  - The elevator map tile and left/right arrow are moved, so they will 
;    be the wrong tile in vanilla maps.
;  - The samus figure in the message box that appears in the Bomb item
;    message box is removed. (opaque version)
;
; This asm was written by TestRunner based on CleanHUD by BlackFalcon,
; which in turn based on the DC Map patch. The main changes in this 
; version is a couple more free tiles, almost all the extended message
; box graphics is available, and the patch is entirely in ASM for
; ease of editting.
