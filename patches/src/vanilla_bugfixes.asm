; See the comments in the bank logs for $86:B6B9 for details on the bug
; The fix here is setting the X register to the enemy projectile index,

;;; For an unknown reason, the save station we put in main street
;;; sometimes (circumstances unclear) spawn two detection PLMs
;;; instead of one. These PLMs are supposed to precisely detect
;;; when Samus is standing on the save. When Samus does, it looks
;;; for a PLM at the same coordinates as itself, which is normally
;;; the actual save station PLM.
;;; But when two detection blocks are spawn, it detects the other detection
;;; block as being the save, and the save station doesn't work.
;;; Therefore, we add an extra check on PLM type to double check it has
;;; actually found the save station PLM.

;;; hijack in detection block PLM code when samus is
;;; positioned correctly

; Fix for offscreen super missile explosion freeze glitch

; See https://discord.com/channels/1053421401354285129/1053434532973510748/1314069283520643113
;
; The bug requires a number of conditions:
;  - diagonal SM shot that reaches velocity to induce read-ahead collision detection (aka SM-link, @ $90B366 / $90B406)
;  - on same frame: SM not colliding, but SM-link colliding both horiz+vert (@ $90B052)
;  - this will corrupt the SM-link projectile entry and create a null spritemap ptr
;
; This ultimately leads to using $0000 as the size/iterator for the spritemap OAM update (@ $818A4B).
; Safest patch is to add null ptr check furthest downstream to not interfere with SM-based glitches.
