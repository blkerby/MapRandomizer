        <p>Each map is partitioned into six connected regions, which are assigned to in-game areas in different ways
          depending on this setting:
        <ul>
          <li><p><strong>Standard</strong>: Landing Site is always in Crateria. Mother Brain Room is always in Tourian. 
            The other areas are assigned based on their size, from largest to smallest: Norfair, Brinstar, Maridia, Wrecked Ship.</p>
          <li><p><strong>Size</strong>: The areas are assigned based on their size (in number of map tiles), from largest 
            to smallest: Norfair, Brinstar, Maridia, Crateria, Tourian, Wrecked Ship.</p>
          <li><p><strong>Depth</strong>: The areas are assigned based on their highest map tile, from highest
            to lowest: Crateria, Wrecked Ship, Tourian, Brinstar, Maridia, Norfair.</p>
          <li><p><strong>Random</strong>: The areas are assigned randomly.</p>
