        <p>Skill assumptions determine which tricks the randomizer assumes the player is able to perform. This affects
          where the randomizer may place key items on any given step. Anything selected here is "fair game" for the
          player to be required to do in order to progress.</p>
        <p>Examples of expected techniques from the skill presets are as follows:</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Basic</strong>: Wall jumps, shinesparks, simple uses of frozen enemies, and navigating heated
              rooms without Varia (but only with plenty of extra energy).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Medium</strong>: 1-tap shortcharge, infinite bomb jumps, sequences of 3 or more wall jumps, and
              underwater movement tech such as crouch jumps, down grabs, mid-air Spring Ball jumps, and Gravity jumps.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Hard</strong>: Stutter 2-tap, mockballs, damage boosts, gate glitching, cross-room jumps from air
              to water rooms, trickier climbing on enemies, and ice clips assisted by Morph and X-Ray.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Very Hard</strong>: Stutter 3-tap, complex shinespark setups, stutter water shortcharges, speedballs, 
              temporary blue suit, Spring Ball jumps off of walls, Flatley jumps, grapple jumps, Crystal Flash, 
              evading Metroids, and using a turn-around to jump around a corner.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Expert</strong>: Stutter 4-tap, double bomb jumping, CWJ, Baby Metroid skip, double Spring Ball jumps,
              crystal flash clips, precise ice clips, temporary blue chains, pause abusing, grapple jumps, and short X-ray climbs.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Extreme</strong>: Double-stutter 4-tap, underwater wall jumps, longer X-ray climbs, crazy crab
              climbs, moonfalls between frozen enemies, and glitched X-ray modes (G-mode, R-mode, X-mode).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Insane</strong>: Triple-stutter 4-tap, Taco Tank, moondances, crossing Colosseum with no movement items,
              very slow & tricky crab climbs, and trickier G-mode setups and applications.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Select one of the preset difficulty levels and then, if desired, refine it by clicking the gear icon on the right 
          and modifying the selections. Note that if you then select a preset again, it will override any
          customized settings that you made. </p>
        <p>The descriptions above are only a summary. Clicking the gear icon will show a list of the tricks in detail, with
          animations. It's recommended to take a look to make sure you understand all the kinds of things that you may
          be expected to be able to do!</p>
