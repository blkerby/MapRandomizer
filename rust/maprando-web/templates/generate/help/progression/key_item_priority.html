        <p>These settings affect how the randomizer prioritizes placing key items, which can be used to nudge the
          randomizer to try to place certain items earlier or later on average. Wide variation should still be expected
          in the results, because of constraints that limit how early or late the randomizer can place a key item in any
          given situation, especially for lower settings of "Skill assumptions".</p>

        <h5>Details</h5>
        <p>At the beginning of each randomization attempt, an item priority order is determined by randomly shuffling
          all the item types, with a bias such that "Early" items (as selected below) tend to come before "Default"
          items, which in turn tend to come before "Late" items. Every item type occurs somewhere in this priority order
          (even Missiles and other filler items), with the exception of "Never" items. The same priority order is used
          across all steps of a given attempt.
        </p>
        <p>On a given step, the randomizer determines the quantity of key items to place based on the "Progression
          rate". It will always begin by attempting to place the first available key item(s) from the priority order in
          two-way reachable locations, along with randomly selected filler items. The randomizer places filler items in
          one-way reachable locations. If the selected combination of items provides progression, then the randomizer
          will accept this placement and move on to the next step. Otherwise, the randomizer replaces the last key item
          with the next one in the priority order and tries again, continuing this way until it either succeeds or all
          item types are exhausted, in which case it will try again with a new map and new item priority order.</p>
