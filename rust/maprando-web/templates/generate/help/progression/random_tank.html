        <p>This setting affects how the key item priority order of Energy Tank vs. Reserve Tank works from step to step:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><b>No</b>: All items, including Energy Tanks and Reserve Tanks, maintain a consistent item priority
              across steps. This means it is more likely that you only get one type of tank for much of the seed
              (especially if tanks are not enabled as filler items).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Yes</b>: The priority of Energy Tanks and Reserve Tanks, relative to each other, is re-randomized on
              every step. This makes it more likely that you get a mixture of the two types of tanks.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
