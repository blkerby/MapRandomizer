        <p>If enabled, Spazer will be prioritized before Plasma both as a key item and as filler (if applicable). This
          makes it more likely that Spazer would be obtainable before Plasma. It could still happen that both beams are
          placed on the same step, or that Plasma is placed first if it would provide progression when Spazer would not.
