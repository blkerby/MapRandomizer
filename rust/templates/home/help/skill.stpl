        <p>Skill assumptions determine which tricks the randomizer assumes the player is able to perform.
        This affects where the randomizer may place key items on any given step. Anything selected here
        is "fair game" for the player to be required to do in order to progress.</p>

        <p>The presets can be summarized as follows:</p>

        <p><ul>
        <li><p><strong>Easy</strong>: No tech is required. The early game can still be challenging, as you
        may encounter dangerous enemies and softlock risks.</p>
        <li><p><strong>Medium</strong>: Basic tech may be required: wall jumps, crouch jumps, down grabs, 
        infinite bomb jumps, shinesparks, and navigating heated/water rooms without suits.</p>
        <li><p><strong>Hard</strong>: Common tech may be required, such as mockballs, damage boosts, 
        gate glitching, Gravity jumps, snail climb, Spring Ball jump, and Mochtroid ice clips.</p>
        <li><p><strong>Very Hard</strong>: Obscure or precise tech may be required, such as
        Flatley jumps, grapple jumps, crystal flash stand-ups, evading Metroids, snail clips, and ice clips 
        assisted by X-ray.</p>
        <li><p><strong>Expert</strong>: Highly precise or unforgiving tech may be required, such as
        CWJ, Baby Metroid skip, double Spring Ball jumps, and pixel-perfect ice clips.</p>
        <li><p><strong>Extreme</strong>: Repetitive or complex tech may be required, such as
        X-ray climbs, long tunnel crawls, crystal flash clips, crazy crab climbs, and glitched X-ray modes
        (G-mode, R-mode, X-mode).</p>
        <li><p><strong>Insane</strong>: Extraordinarily difficult or time-consuming tech may be required,
        such as Taco Tank, Multiviola ice clip, and the very slowest/trickiest crab climbs.</p>
        </ul></p>

        <p>Select one of the preset difficulty levels and then, if desired, refine it by expanding the
        "Customize skill assumption" box below and modifying the selections. Note that if you then
        select a preset again, it will override any customized settings that you made.</p>

        <p>The amount of relevant tricks is large in this randomizer due to the large variety of situations that
        can arise in randomized maps. Improving the organization of these settings is a work in progress!
