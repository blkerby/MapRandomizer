        <ul>
        <li>Be sure to save frequently! Saves are fast, and saving at a different station from the last save will move 
        to the next slot before saving, so you can go back to an earlier save if you get stuck.
        <li>Be careful with one-ways: it's easy to get soft-locked. The logic never requires going down a one-way 
        for an item unless there is a way back to the Ship without using the new item. It's often best to avoid one-ways
        until you know there's a way back or have exhausted all other options.
        <li>If you can't find any way to progress, don't give up! Check out the interactive spoiler map below to see
        what the game intended. If it still seems impossible or too difficult, please let us know in the

        <h6>Special inputs</h6>
        <ul>
        <li>Press Select in the pause map to cycle through maps of explored areas.
        <li>Press L + R + Select + Start simultaneously to quick reload from the last save. 
        Repeat to cycle through previous saves.
        <li>Press Angle Up + Item Cancel simultaneously to mark the current tile un-explored on the map.  
        To be effective, these inputs must be
        held while exiting the tile, since otherwise the game will immediately re-explore the tile.
        </ul>
        <h6>Map info</h6>
        <ul>
        <li>Every Zebes room from the vanilla game is placed somewhere. Once all movement items are
        collected, it is possible to reach every room without any tech.
        <li>Phantoon's Room always connects to the same room as the broken map station, and both are 
            in the same area as the broken save room.
        <li>The map uses special tiles to show the locations of map stations, refills, 
        and major bosses (G4 and Mother Brain). Items are consistently marked using dots.
        </ul>
        
        <h6>Item info</h6>
        <ul>
        <% if all_items_spawn { %>
        <li>The planet is awakened by killing the enemies (not including bosses or minibosses) 
        in a room where this unlocks a gray door.<a href="#footnote-pit-room"><sup>1</sup></a>
        <% } else { %>
        <li>Certain items do not spawn until the planet is awakened, by killing the enemies (not including bosses or minibosses) 
        in a room where this unlocks a gray door.<a href="#footnote-pit-room"><sup>1</sup></a>
        <li>Certain items do not spawn until Phantoon has been defeated, the same as in the vanilla game.
        <% } %>
        <li>Every item from the vanilla game is placed somewhere, and ammo distributions are unchanged; e.g. there are 50 Supers in the game.
        <li>Varia suit behaves as in vanilla, but Gravity suit alone provides no heat protection and only 50% protection against other damage. 
        The suits are "complementary", meaning they stack to give the same effect as combined suits in the vanilla game.
        </ul>

        <h6>Other info</h6>
        <ul>
        <li>Missile Refill stations refill all ammo types: Missiles, Supers, and Power Bombs.
        <% if supers_double { %>
        <li>Supers do double damage to Mother Brain (a quality-of-life option).
        <% } %>
        <li>Hyper Beam destroys Super, Bomb, and Power Bomb blocks and can open blue & green gates from either side.
        </ul>

    <sup>1</sup>This can be done in the following rooms: Pit Room (old Mother Brain room), Baby Kraid Room, Metal Pirates Room,
    and Plasma Room. These are the rooms that involve killing Space Pirates to unlock the doors in the vanilla game.
